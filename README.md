# BANK

This is a simple bank website, the general idea is, you have to register and login to your account, now that you are logged in, you have to register your credit card number and deposit some funds to start working with it.
After you deposit some funds, you can deposit more or withdrawl, every time you deposit or withdrawl money, it will by added or substracted from the database of your account, of course, it wont let you withdrawl a bigger amount of money than you have in your account.
The most important funcionality is the transference.The general idea is that you can transfer money to other users registered in this website, again,you can only transfer as much money as you have in your account.
To being able to make a transference, you wil indicate the person though his/her email,the website will check in the database if the user exist and if it does it will substract the money from your account and add it automaticly to his funds, this transference will also be saved in the db.Every time you log into your account, the website will check in the db if there is a transference made to your account, if there is one or more, it will print all the transferences, the users and the money amount they transfered to you. After the information about the transference is printed in your screen, all the transferences will be deleted automaticly from the db, in this way, you can save some memory from information that you dont need anymore, and, after you refresh, all the information of the transferences made tou you wont be in the screen, of course, the money transfered to you will reamin added to your funds in the database.
I made this website in MVC OOP, some parts of the website, mainly the main page dont work in MVC because i wanted to print all the information automaticly from the db without having to call a lot of actions and abstractions, but 90% of the website is pure MVC.
